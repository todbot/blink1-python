## About this library

Features of this library:

* Test coverage on all library components
* Python 3.x and Python 2.7.x compatible
* Automatic installation via Python Package Index
* High level control over the blink(1)
* Single implementation with `cython-hidapi` USB HID API (PyUSB cannot access HID devices on all OSes)

This library lives at https://github.com/todbot/blink1-python

Originally written by @salimfadhley, at https://github.com/salimfadhley/blink1/tree/master/python/pypi.
Moved to this repository and rewritten for `cython-hidapi` by @todbot.

## Installation

Use the `pip` utility to fetch the latest release of this package and any
additional components required in a single step:
```
  pip install blink1
```

## Example Code and Installed scripts
Two command-line scripts `blink1-shine` and `blink1-flash` are installed when this library is installed.
* `blink1-shine` – Tell the blink(1) to be specifc steady color
* `blink1-flash` – Flash the blink(1) two different colors at a specific rate

For examples, see the [`blink1_demo`](./blink1_demo/) directory for several examples on how to use this library.

## OS-specific notes
The `blink1-python` library relies on [cython-hidapi](https://github.com/trezor/cython-hidapi) for USB HID access.  This package may require a C compiler and attendant utilities to be installed before installing this library.

### Linux:
The following extra packages must be installed:
```
  sudo apt-get install python-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libudev-dev
```
And udev rules for non-root user access to blink(1) devices:
```
  echo 'SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="27b8", ATTRS{idProduct}=="01ed", MODE:="666", GROUP="plugdev"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/51-blink1.rules
  sudo udevadm control --reload
  sudo udevadm trigger
```

### Mac OS X:
Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) with command-line tools.

### Windows:
You may need [Microsoft Visual C++ Compiler for Python 2.7](http://aka.ms/vcpython27)

## Use

The simplest way to use this library is via a context manager.
```
  import time
  from blink1.blink1 import blink1

  with blink1() as b1:
    b1.fade_to_color(100, 'navy')
    time.sleep(10)
```

When the blink1() block exits the light is automatically switched off.
It is also possible to access the exact same set of functions without the context manager:
```
  import time
  from blink1.blink1 import Blink1

  b1 = Blink1()
  b1.fade_to_rgb(1000, 64, 64, 64)
  time.sleep(3)
  b1.fade_to_rgb(1000, 255, 255, 255)
```

Unlike the context manager, this demo will leave the blink(1) open at the end of execution.
To close it, use the `b1.close()` method.

To list all connected blink(1) devices:
```
  from blink1.blink1 import Blink1
  blink1_serials = Blink1.list()
  print("blink(1) devices found: " + ','.join(blink1_serials))
```

To open a particular blink(1) device by serial number, pass in its serial number as a Unicode string:
```
  from blink1.blink1 import blink1
  blink1 = Blink1(serial_number=u'20002345')
  blink1.fade_to_rgb(1000, 255,0,255)
  blink1.close()
```

### Colors

There are a number of ways to specify colors in this library:
```
  blink1.fade_to_color(1000, '#ffffff') # Hexdecimal RGB as a string
  blink1.fade_to_color(1000, 'green') # Named color - any color name understood by css3
  blink1.fade_to_color(1000, (22,33,44) # RGB as a tuple. Luminance values are 0 <= lum <= 255
```
Attempting to select a color outside the plausible range will generate an InvalidColor exception.


### Pattern playing

The blink(1) device has a 16-line non-volatile color pattern memory.
This color pattern plays automatically if power is applied but not connected to a computer.
You can also trigger this pattern (or sub-patterns) over USB,
leaving your application free to do other things besides blink lights.

Each line in the color pattern consists of an R,G,B triplet and a fade time to reach that color.

To play the pattern in blink(1) or sub-patterns:
```
blink1.play()  # play entire color pattern, infinitely looped
blink1.stop()  # stop a color pattern playing (if playing)

blink1.play(2,3, count=7)  # play color pattern lines 2,3 in a loop 7 times
```

To alter the lines of the pattern memory:
```
# write 100msec fades to green then yellow then black at lines 3,4,5
blink1.write_pattern_line( 100, 'green',  3)
blink1.write_pattern_line( 100, 'yellow', 4)
blink1.write_pattern_line( 100, 'black',  5)

blink1.play( 3,5, 4)  # play that sub-loop 4 times
```

To save the pattern to non-volatile memory (overwriting the factory pattern):
```
blink1.save_pattern()
```

To quickly play a pattern in Blink1Control-style string format:
```
# play purple on LED1 in 300ms, green on LED2 in 100ms, then swap, for 10 times
pattern_str = '10, #ff00ff,0.3,1, #00ff00,0.1,2,  #ff00ff,0.3,2, #00ff00,0.1,1'
blink1.play_pattern(pattern_str)
# wait 5 seconds while the pattern plays on the blink1
# (or go do something more useful)
time.sleep(5.0)
# flash red-off 5 times fast on all LEDs
blink1.play_pattern('5, #FF0000,0.2,0,#000000,0.2,0')
```

### Servertickle watchdog
blink(1) also has a "watchdog" of sorts called "servertickle".
When enabled, you must periodically send it to the blink(1) or it will
trigger, playing the stored color pattern.  This is useful to announce
a computer that has crashed.  The blink(1) will flash on its own until
told otherwise.

To use, enable severtickle with a timeout value (max timeout 62 seconds):
```
blink1.server_tickle(enable=True, timeout_millis=2000)
```


### Gamma correction

The context manager supports a ''gamma'' argument which allows you to supply a per-channel gamma correction value.
```
  from blink1.blink1 import blink1

  with blink1(gamma=(2, 2, 2)) as b1:
    b1.fade_to_color(100, 'pink')
    time.sleep(10)
```
This example provides a gamma correction of 2 to each of the three colour channels.

Higher values of gamma make the blink(1) appear more colorful but decrease the brightness of colours.

### White point correction

The human eye's perception of color can be influenced by ambient lighting. In some circumstances it may be desirable
to apply a small color correction in order to make colors appear more accurate. For example, if we were operating
the blink(1) in a room lit predominantly by candle-light:
```
  with blink1(white_point='candle', switch_off) as b1:
    b1.fade_to_color(100, 'white')
```
Viewed in daylight this would make the Blink(1) appear yellowish, however in a candle-lit room this would be perceived
as a more natural white. If we did not apply this kind of color correction the Blink(1) would appear blueish.

The following values are acceptable white-points:

* Any triple of (r,g,b). Each 0 <= luminance <= 255
* Any color_temperature expressed as an integer or float in Kelvin
* A color temperature name.

The library supports the following temperature names:

* candle
* sunrise
* incandescent
* tungsten
* halogen
* sunlight
* overcast
* shade
* blue-sky

## Developer installation

Having checked out the `blink1-python` library, cd to its directory and run the setup script:
```
  git clone https://github.com/todbot/blink1-python
  cd blink1-python
  python3 setup.py develop
  python3 ./blink1_demo/demo1.py
```
or
```
  pip3 install --editable .
```
You can now use the `blink1` package on your system and edit it.

To get internal blink1 library debug, messages set the environment variable `DEBUGBLINK1`:
```
DEBUGBLINK1=1 python3 ./blink1_demo/demo1.py
```

To uninstall the development version:
```
  python3 setup.py develop --uninstall
```
